**When did you start doing web development?**

I started building web pages for local businesses in 1999 largely based around HTML/CSS (who doesn't remember Dreamweaver and even at one point Microsoft FrontPage!) and Flash (all Flash websites (hmmmm?!?!)). I started using tech such as initially Perl and quickly on to PHP from about 2001/2, with one of my great loves MySQL.

**Can you juggle with more than three balls?**

No, I'm still trying,but currently trying to get to grips with hoops and clubs (which I'm finding a bit of a challenge.

**Which frameworks do you prefer?**

I joined this party late, having spent many years under the idea that I wanted to code everything myself, to know every detail of every aspect of a codebase. So I'm now jumping at every opportunity to try any frameworks; particular favourites so far include Zend 2 on a particularly high profile Channel 4 project, and Symfony 2 (which I think would have to be the out and out winner (thus far)) both personally and on a project for the BFI.

**You mentioned photography: what do you shoot with?**

I have always shot Nikon (I say always, I haven't been shooting with SLR's for years and years, only since the D3000) but I'm now using and loving the D600, it's quite weighty but takes some great shots.
