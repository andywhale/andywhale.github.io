Following 3 years heading up IT & Web infrastructure at the UK's largest independant financial compliance network, I now have the joy of working with clients including Blue Cross, Cancer Research UK, the Equality & Human Rights Commission, Bournemouth University, the BFI and Channel 4 with the fantastic digital agency Numiko.

**When did you start your career in web development?**

I started building web pages for local businesses in 1999 (age 15) largely based around HTML/CSS (who doesn't remember Dreamweaver and even at one point Microsoft FrontPage!) and Flash (all Flash websites (hmmmm?!?!)). I started using tech such as initially Perl and quickly on to PHP from about 2001/2, with one of my great loves MySQL.

**Can you juggle with more than three balls?**

No, I'm still trying, but currently trying to get to grips with hoops and clubs (which I'm finding a bit of a challenge).

**Which frameworks do you prefer?**

I joined this party late, having spent many years under the idea that I wanted to code everything myself, to know every detail of every aspect of a codebase. So I'm now jumping at every opportunity to try any frameworks; particular favourites so far include Zend 2 on a particularly high profile Channel 4 project, and Symfony 2 (which I think would have to be the out and out winner (thus far)) both personally and on a project for the BFI.

**Where do you work?**

I have the great privilege of working for one of the best design agencies in the UK (in my view); Numiko, they build web apps and content managed sites for all kinds of organisations and I personally have had the chance to work on and technically lead projects for the likes of Channel 4, the BFI, Cancer Research UK, the Equality & Human Rights Commission, Bournemouth University, Raw TV, among others. All of these projects have included great challenges and I always look forward to my next with Numiko as they have such a great vision leading to a great client base.

**You mentioned photography: what do you shoot with?**

I have always shot Nikon (I say always, I haven't been shooting with SLR's for years and years, only since the D3000) but I'm now using and loving the D600, it's quite weighty but takes some great shots.

**Do you have any experience with CMS development?**

Yes, I have now been using Drupal for a couple of years, and while I realise it has numerous flaws (in so much as any out of the box CMS does) it is very effective at what it does though, and I am a big fan of it's ease of reuse with custom modules built once to solve a problem and then reinstalled over and over again.
