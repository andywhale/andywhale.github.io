The wall itself is a site to behold, and when you finally manage to put yourselves in the shoes of the Roman's who built it and get your head around the fact that it is nearly 2000 years old that makes it even more awe inspiring.

The Vindalanda Museum really helps in getting things in context, with their massive collection of artifacts, including shoes, weapons, coins and most impressive of all letters written by the Romans.

Among the locations visited on the Wall were Housesteads Roman Fort and Chesters Fort (+ bath house).

We also made it across to another wall town - Hexham - and visited the Abbey, which is an impressive building, with some amazing stained glass.
