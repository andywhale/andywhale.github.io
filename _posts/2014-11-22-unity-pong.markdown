It's no secret that since the likes of Commander Keen on my 286 I've been hooked on platformers, specifically of the 2D variety. It's a format that has always been around and its probably fair to say they are as popular now as ever with XBox Arcade, games for mobile, PS Vita, among other platforms.

Ever since playing those games I've wanted to build a platformer but never found the time, well last week I started out my joruney with beginning to play about with Unity, following a number of tutorials, etc.

My first 2D game is gravity pong, after each point is scored the gravity is reset to a new planet or heavenly body. The controls are fairly simple Player One (W & S) and Player Two (Up & Down). You can download my first attempt for <a href="/gravitypong/GravityPong.tgz">mac</a> or <a href="/gravitypong/GravityPong.zip">pc</a> now.
