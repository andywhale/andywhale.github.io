As many of you will be aware I am a keen photographer, on top of that I am a very keen follower of natural history. I stand among the millions of fans of every documentary that Sir David Attenborough has ever been a part of, I have read everything Mark Carwardine has ever written (along with his co-written part in Douglas Adams Last Chance to Save - an absolute must read). Standing behind Attenborough is a massively talented team of wildlife cameramen and women, but none in my view come close to the amazing scenes captured by Doug Allan.

This is already becoming a bit of a list of a connections and I'm afraid we've got even further to go. While I was looking through Doug's book ["Freeze Frame"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Freeze-Frame-Wildlife-Cameramans-Adventures/dp/0957139209) - which has some amazing photos and tracks the course of his career in becoming the now much loved go to arctic cameraman - it makes a book recommendation, which is Ian Stirling's ["Polar Bears - The Natural History of a Threatened Species"](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Polar-Bears-Stirling-Ian/dp/1408190680/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1418759802&sr=8-6&keywords=polar+bears), I believe Doug refers to it as definitive, and wow is he right!

This book really does give a solid overview of the natural history of the polar bear, from its initial evolution, to its population distributions over time, and includes travel tips if you wish to go looking for polar bears. There is in fact so much that it would be foolish for me to try and include it here, but what I would say is if you have any interest in natural history, and specifically if you find the mystery surrounding the planets largest carnivore then grab this and give it a read. Don't be intimidated by its text-book like appearance Stirling is a fantastic writer that brings this natural history to life.

You'll also find the sheer volume of facts contained within so interesting that you'll be keen to share with everyone you know; such as the inner workings of the Polar Bears walking hibernation - I know!
