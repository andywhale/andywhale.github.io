## PHP++

This week saw a decision taken in the next release of PHP - the number. 
This may seem like an odd point of contention as the follow-up to PHP 5 should be a case of some fairly basic maths (PHP++), 
unfortunately there has already been an attempt at PHP 6 (started in 2005 and abandoned in 2010) and many of it's features found
there way into PHP 5.3. Therefore the decision has been taken to avoid confusion and to jump to version 7.

## More than a number

The most exciting talk about the next release of PHP surround it's feature concentration, and the key buzz is around performance,
almost certainly as response to alternative PHP variants such as Facebook's HHVM (for which they released a formal spec for the language [https://github.com/php/php-langspec/tree/master/spec]).

A really interesting article on phpclasses goes into more detail:
