Without a doubt the experience of the holiday, a trip out to see the Grey Seals on the Farne Islands, the crew really knew their stuff and we saw so many seals. The trip became even more amazing when you finally got into your head that these were not coerced into being there, this was not a David Attenborough documentary, this was not a zoo, these were real sea mammals in their natural habitat just off our coastline - Incredible.
