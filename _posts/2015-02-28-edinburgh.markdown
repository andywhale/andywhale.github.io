A great weekend in Edinburgh consisting of some fantastic food, great historic sites and amazing museums. The museums included both the National Museum of Scotland and National Portrait Gallery, and the history continued with Edinburgh castle.

But I would admit that the highlight was the vast quantities of food eaten, and I just wanted to mention recommendations of all of the amazing eateries.

[Henderson's Bistro](http://www.hendersonsofedinburgh.co.uk) - this place has a great informal atmosphere, and the Hungarian Bean burger is delicious; if you're after tasty vegetarian cuisine the you should visit this place.

[Smoke Stack](http://www.smokestack.org.uk) - at the other end of the spectrum, a carnivores dream traditional breakfast with sausage, bacon, black pudding and the all important baked beans, among the usual mushrooms, fried eggs, etc. I can honestly say I think this is the best breakfast ever, and Kate thoroughly enjoyed waffles with banana and chocolate sauce.

I also took some photos at Edinburgh Castle.
