Kielder Water & Forest feels like an undiscovered secret after you get past the "holiday park" there is a world to explore. With moss covered ground next to rugged coastal walks, all accompanied by huge man made forest, this place will definetly keep you walking for hours, and there is always the possibility of happening upon a great vista or magnificient and engaging sculpture.

This part of our holiday also saw us taking in the tiny town of Bellingham, alongside yet another hidden gem in the form of Hareshaw Linn; a 50ft waterfall which - while a frequent attraction to the Victorians - now seems almost off the grid.

On our way toward the coast we stopped off at Belsay Castle & Gardens, the gardens were definetly the highlight, with some exotic plant life.
