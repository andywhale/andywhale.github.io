## Our Visit

Having only visited briefly once before, I had not realised quite how vast and stunning this arboretum is, my father-in-law volunteers here (I can understand why, it's beautiful) and so we got taken along for a guided tour of the projects in progress. All i can say is "what a place" and I can't wait for our next visit.

## Photos

I did of course have my camera to hand, and fortunately the flora & fauna lends itself naturally to photography.
