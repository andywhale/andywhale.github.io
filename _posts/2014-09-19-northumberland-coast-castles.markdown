As we moved toward the coast line there was to be a major increase in the number of castles, with both Alnwick & Dunstanburgh Castle visited (there are many more castles but we didn't get around to visiting them all).

We also made a trip out to Holy Island (only visitable during low tide, due to a tidal causeway), I would highly recommend a visit to this island, to see both the Priory and to walk the perimeter.
