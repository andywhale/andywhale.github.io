The newest edition to my board game collection has been Power Grid, and easily pushes it's way into second place (first place has to go to Ticket to Ride, and I'm sure always will). It's an amazing game of buying and selling power commodities and building up cities but also having the resources to power them.

Disclaimer: At this point I have to mention that both of my folks work for a power company so I cannot be sure that I have not been influenced from an early age, and this could be why I enjoyed the game so much.

# The Rules

Disclaimers aside there is only issue with this game and I have subsequently learned it's a well-known issue: the rules.

We spent a long time going through the rules ahead of playing, and believing this to be a complicated game, only to find that once you got started it's a VERY straightforward game.

First up you set up the board as per the rule book, now here is my cut down version of the rest:

1. Determine player order: The player to go first is the player with the most cities (and a tie is decided by the highest number power plant).
2. Bid on a power station from those in the current market (top row), if you pass on your go you may not bid on anyone else's go.
3. [Reverse Player Order] Buy resources for any of your power plants (plants can hold twice the number of resources shown on the card).
4. [Reverse Player Order] Buy cities, these must be connected to your exisiting network, and so you pay the connection fee shown on the pipe and the 10 cost on the city (one person per city in step 1)
5. Bureaucracy: For every city you own and have the resources to power; you can trade in resources (non-renewable) and collect the appropriate amount of cash from the bank, after this resources are restocked (see rules) and the highest cost power plant in the future market is placed at the bottom of the deck.

... repeat

Having started this I found that as always Board Game Geek was on hand to offer a good FAQ on this game, well worth checking out.
