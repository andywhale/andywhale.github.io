The newest edition to my board game collection has been Power Grid, and easily pushes it's way into second place. It's an amazing game of buying and selling power commodities and building up cities but also having the resources to power them.

Disclaimer: At this point I have to mention that both of my folks work for a power company so I cannot be sure that I have not been influenced from an early age, and this could be why I enjoyed the game so much.

# The Rules

Disclaimers aside there is only issue with this game and I have subsequently learned it's a well-known issue: the rules.

We spent a long time going through the rules ahead of playing, and believing this to be a complicated game, only to find that once you got started it's a VERY straightforward game.

First up you set up the board as per the rule book, now here is my cut down version of the rest:

## Step 1

The player to go first is the player with the most cities (and a tie is decided by the highest number power plant).

1. Bid on a power station from those in the current market (top row), if you pass on your go you may not bid on anyone else's go.
2. Buy resources for any of your power plants (plants can hold twice the number of resources shown).
3.
